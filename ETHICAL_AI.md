# Yardly Ethical AI Guidelines

## Introduction

At Yardly, we believe that AI should enhance human decision-making, not replace it. Our ethical AI framework ensures that technology serves candidates and recruiters fairly, transparently, and responsibly.

## Core Principles

### 1. Transparency

**Principle**: Every AI decision must be explainable and transparent to all parties.

**Implementation**:
- All AI decisions are logged in `AIDecisionLog` with:
  - Model version used
  - Input data (anonymized)
  - Output and confidence score
  - Human-readable explanation
  - Features/factors considered
- Candidates can see AI match scores and understand why
- Recruiters understand AI recommendations and can override them

**Code Example**:
```python
# Every AI decision creates a log entry
AIDecisionLog.objects.create(
    application=application,
    decision_type='screening',
    model_version='v1.2.0',
    input_data={'skills': [...], 'experience': 5},
    output_data={'match_score': 0.85},
    confidence_score=0.85,
    explanation="Strong match based on relevant experience and skill alignment...",
    features_used=['skills', 'experience', 'location']
)
```

### 2. Fairness and Bias Prevention

**Principle**: AI systems must be regularly audited for bias and fairness across all demographics.

**Implementation**:
- Regular bias audits across multiple dimensions:
  - Gender
  - Race/Ethnicity
  - Age
  - Geographic location
  - Educational background
- Documented in `BiasAuditLog` model
- Corrective actions required when bias is detected
- Sample size and statistical significance considered

**Audit Schedule**:
- Monthly comprehensive audits
- Weekly spot checks
- Immediate audit after model updates
- Quarterly external audits

### 3. Human Oversight

**Principle**: AI provides recommendations, not final decisions. Humans make the ultimate choices.

**Implementation**:
- `human_reviewed` flag required for all critical decisions
- `human_override` capability with required justification
- Reviewers identified in logs
- Override patterns monitored for bias

**Code Example**:
```python
# AI decision requires human review
if settings.HUMAN_REVIEW_REQUIRED:
    ai_decision.human_reviewed = True
    ai_decision.reviewed_by = current_user
    ai_decision.save()
```

### 4. Privacy Protection

**Principle**: Candidate data is protected, and access is logged and controlled.

**Implementation**:
- All data access logged in `DataPrivacyLog`
- Purpose and consent documented
- Anonymization when used for AI training
- Right to be forgotten supported
- Data minimization - only collect what's needed

**Data Access Types**:
- View: Someone views candidate data
- Export: Data is exported/downloaded
- Delete: Data is deleted
- Anonymize: Data is anonymized for analytics
- AI Training: Data used in model training (with consent)

### 5. Explainability

**Principle**: Candidates and recruiters understand how and why AI makes recommendations.

**Implementation**:
- Plain language explanations required
- Feature importance shown
- Example comparisons provided
- No black-box decisions

**Example Explanation**:
```
Match Score: 85%

Why this score?
✓ Your 5 years of Python experience matches the requirement (30% weight)
✓ Experience with Django framework directly relevant (25% weight)
✓ Location preference aligns with remote option (15% weight)
✓ Salary expectations within range (10% weight)
⚠ Limited experience with specific tools mentioned (20% weight)
```

## Implementation Details

### Model Versioning

All AI models are versioned and changes are tracked:
- Version number format: `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- Changelog maintained for all versions
- A/B testing for significant changes
- Rollback capability

### Training Data

Training data must be:
- Diverse and representative
- Regularly updated
- Anonymized and aggregated
- Consent-based where applicable
- Balanced across demographics

### Performance Metrics

We monitor:
- Accuracy across different demographic groups
- False positive/negative rates by category
- User satisfaction scores
- Override rates and reasons
- Appeal success rates

### Continuous Improvement

- Monthly review of AI performance
- Quarterly ethics committee meetings
- Annual external audits
- Community feedback integration
- Regular model retraining with updated data

## Ethical AI Guidelines Database

All guidelines are documented in the `EthicalAIGuideline` model:

```python
EthicalAIGuideline.objects.create(
    title="Transparency in Screening",
    description="All screening decisions must include explanation...",
    principle="Transparency",
    implementation_details="Log all decisions, show to candidates...",
    version="1.0",
    is_active=True
)
```

## Candidate Rights

Candidates have the right to:

1. **Know**: Understand how AI is used in their application
2. **Explain**: Receive clear explanations of AI decisions
3. **Appeal**: Challenge AI recommendations
4. **Opt-out**: Request human-only review
5. **Access**: See all their data and how it's used
6. **Delete**: Request data deletion (right to be forgotten)
7. **Correct**: Fix inaccurate information

## Recruiter Responsibilities

Recruiters must:

1. Review all AI recommendations before acting
2. Provide personalized feedback (not just AI scores)
3. Override AI when human judgment differs
4. Document override reasons
5. Maintain fairness in manual decisions
6. Report potential bias or issues
7. Participate in bias training

## Bias Monitoring Process

### Detection

1. Regular statistical analysis
2. Demographic parity checks
3. Equal opportunity analysis
4. Disparate impact testing
5. Community feedback review

### Response

When bias is detected:

1. **Immediate**: Flag for review
2. **24 hours**: Investigation started
3. **48 hours**: Initial findings
4. **1 week**: Corrective action plan
5. **2 weeks**: Implementation
6. **4 weeks**: Verification audit

### Severity Levels

- **None**: No bias detected
- **Low**: Minor statistical variance, monitoring
- **Medium**: Significant variance, action required
- **High**: Substantial bias, immediate intervention
- **Critical**: Systematic bias, model suspension

## Prohibited Practices

Yardly AI systems must NEVER:

1. Use protected characteristics as direct inputs (except for bias monitoring)
2. Make decisions without human review
3. Provide unexplained recommendations
4. Train on biased historical data without correction
5. Operate without regular audits
6. Hide limitations from users
7. Override explicit user preferences

## Accountability

### Roles and Responsibilities

- **AI Ethics Officer**: Overall accountability
- **Data Scientists**: Model development and monitoring
- **Recruiters**: Proper use and override decisions
- **Legal Team**: Compliance and rights protection

- GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
- EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) guidelines
- Fair Credit Reporting Act principles
- State-specific AI regulation
